## TL;DR

- [Get API access enabled](#api-access)
- [Generate API keys](generate-keys)


## API access

After completing account setup, you can request API access.

{% callout type="note" title="In Sandbox, API access is enabled by default" %}
In Sandbox, your Qredo user automatically obtains API access once your account is set up.
{% /callout %}

{% tabs %}

{% tab label="Production Environment" %}
[Sign up](https://qredo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404085365649-Creating-Your-Account)/sign in to your account on the live [Qredo Web Application](https://qredo.network/signin).

{% /tab %}


{% tab label="Sandbox Environment" %}
[Sign up](https://qredo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404085365649-Creating-Your-Account)/sign in to your account on the sandbox [Qredo Web Application](https://sandbox.qredo.network).

{% /tab %}

{% /tabs %}


1. [Select the account you require](/user-guides/api-keys#select-the-account) and click **Settings**.

2. Select the **Preferences** tab to display the following screen:
    
    ![sbboxdialog](/images/partner-api/disabled-api-access.png)

3. In the **Partner API** box, click **Apply** to open an enrollment form.

    Only required for the production environment, in the sandbox, API capability is initiated by default.

4. Complete the enrollment form and provide a business email address. 

    Personal email addresses are not accepted.

5. After you are done, click **Submit**. This is the final step.

    You should receive email confirmation of your application. Our team will review your application and get back to you by email within one or two business days.

Once accepted, your next step is to [generate keys](generate-keys) for API access and use.
