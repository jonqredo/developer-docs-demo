## Qredo: Self-custody solutions

Your Qredo account acts as a gateway to a rich ecosystem of API-first DeFi and Web3 products and services. 

Qredo's secure Wallets enable everyone, from institutions to individual users, to trade digital assets under custody and removes the vulnerabilities associated with a single private key. By applying multi-party computation (MPC) and leveraging a fully-customizable custody suite, Qredo's customers are empowered to trade across Web3 with confidence.

While the base product suite is available from the Qredo Web App and custody-controlled signing from the Mobile App, Qredo is committed to providing builders with an API-first service.
