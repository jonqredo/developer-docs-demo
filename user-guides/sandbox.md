|Sandbox Web App v1|

This page guides you through signing up to the Sandbox Qredo Web App. The flow is similar to creating a [Qredo Account](https://qredo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404085365649-Creating-Your-Account).

Supports|
-------- |
[Partner API](/api-reference/partner-api)|

## Prerequisites

- At least 10 minutes to complete sign up
- Smart phone to support the Signing App

## Sign up

1. Navigate to [https://sandbox.qredo.network/signin](https://sandbox.qredo.network/signin).
2. If you don't have an account, click "Join Qredo".

3. Follow the registration flow and sign in

> You need to pair your mobile to authenticate approvals on Sandbox, even if you will eventually set up [Signing Agent](/developer-guides/signing-agent).


## What next?

To use the Sandbox Web App to mirror the like-live experience, you should enable [testnet assets](/user-guides/testnet).

Also consider whether you want to use a [Personal account or Organization account](/glossary/accounts) for the test experience.

{% callout type="warning" %}
Sandbox the Web App links to the Signing App on your mobile. Do not confuse this with Sandbox environments provided for API testing. While such environments complement this Web App in that they both allow testing, they use different tech stacks and many not be integrated in all instances.
